# Agar-Io-Clone
Holds a clone/spin off of the popular web game Agar.Io that I made back in 2011

If you would like to play, download the folder titled 'Agar' and run the .jar file

Source code is located in folder titled 'Agar_Source', due to loss of original files comments
were generated automatically upon retrieving files. Also, due to this being written at a young
age much is left without comments.
